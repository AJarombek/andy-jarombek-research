### Overview

Monorepo for engineering research written by Andy Jarombek.  This repository will eventually replace existing 
research repositories, such as [assembly-programming](https://github.com/AJarombek/assembly-programming/) and 
[devops-prototypes](https://github.com/AJarombek/devops-prototypes/).  Fully tested code samples
from those repositories will be migrated here, and the old repositories will be archived.

Hopefully, this approach will make it easier to find and reference research code samples.  It will also make it easier 
to keep research code samples up to date with the latest technologies.

### Commands

**Run GitHub Actions Locally**

```bash
# Install the act CLI
brew install act

# Run a specific GitHub Actions workflow
act -W '.github/workflows/go-tests.yml'
```
